Scanf takes a pointer as an argument, thereby meaning it needs the addressOf operator as the address is the pointer.


	for(i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
		count = 1;  
        for(j = i+1; j < array_size; j++) {  
            if(my_dynamic_array[i]==my_dynamic_array[j]) {   
                count++;
            }  
        }
           	printf("there are %d counts of %d in this array\n", count, my_dynamic_array[i]);
    }
