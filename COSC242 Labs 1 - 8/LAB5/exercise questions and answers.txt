a) in order to be able to reuse the code?

b)char

c)so that we get the null bit to be counted

d) yes, assuming it is either in a strcpy or is repositioning pointers, a simple swap method won’t work

e) because the limit is 80, and indexing starts at 0, so there are 80 items ranging from 0 up to 79

f)



(a) Notice that we have moved the memory allocation and subsequent error checking
code into a separate emalloc function. What is the point of doing this?

(b) What is the type of wordlist[0][0]?


(c) Why do we allocate (strlen(word) + 1) of those rather than just strlen(word)?

(d) Is the statement wordlist[i] = wordlist[j] correct (assuming i and j are inrange
integers)?

(e) Why do you think there is a 79 between the % and s in the scanf format string?

(f) Draw a diagram of wordlist after the program has read in the words “do”,
“cats”, “eat”, “bats”
